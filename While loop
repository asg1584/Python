# We use while loop until a condition is not suitable.


def attempts(n):

attempts(5)

""" The result is 
Attempt1
Attempt2
Attempt3
Attempt4
Attempt5
it is same as
This is the original result. But if we can not write line 9 with correct indentation we get the result:

def attempts(n):
    x = 1
    while x <= n:
        print("Attempt" + str(x))
        x += 1
        print("it is same as" + str(n))
        
attempts(5)

Attempt1
it is same as5
Attempt2
it is same as5
Attempt3
it is same as5
Attempt4
it is same as5
Attempt5
it is same as5
So that indentation is very important"""
