"""PART 3: The not Logical Operator
There is no logical operator in Javascript and it helps to much to code to write.
The not logical operator inverts the value of the comparison expression. This is a helpful tool when you want to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is not present.
If the conditional  expression is True, the not logical operator can be added to make the expression not True (False). 
If the conditional  expression is False, the not logical operator can be added to make the expression not False (True).  """

x = 2*3 > 6
print("The value of x is:")

print("The inverse value of x is:")
print(not x)

"""The value of x is:
False

The inverse value of x is:
True"""
